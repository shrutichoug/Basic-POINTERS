# Basic-POINTERS

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.

A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.

The address of the variable you are working with is assigned to the pointer

The general form of a pointer variable declaration is âˆ’

   type *var-name;
Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the name of the pointer variable.

The asterisk * is used to declare a pointer.

Example:-

    int myAge = 43;     // An int variable
    int* ptr = &myAge;  // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of myAge

    // Output the value of myAge (43)
    printf("%d\n", myAge);

    // Output the memory address of myAge (0x7ffe5367e044)
    printf("%p\n", &myAge);

    // Output the memory address of myAge with the pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)
    printf("%p\n", ptr);
DEREFERENCE
Create a pointer variable with the name ptr, that points to an int variable (myAge). Note that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're working with (int in our example).

Use the & operator to store the memory address of the myAge variable, and assign it to the pointer.

Now, ptr holds the value of myAge's memory address.

In the example above, we used the pointer variable to get the memory address of a variable (used together with the & reference operator).

You can also get the value of the variable the pointer points to, by using the * operator (the dereference operator):

Example:-

  int myAge = 43;     // Variable declaration
  int* ptr = &myAge;  // Pointer declaration

  // Reference: Output the memory address of myAge with the pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)
  printf("%p\n", ptr);

  // Dereference: Output the value of myAge with the pointer (43)
  printf("%d\n", *ptr);
Pointers are one of the things that make C stand out from other programming languages, like Python and Java.

They are important in C, because they allow us to manipulate the data in the computer's memory. This can reduce the code and improve the performance. If you are familiar with data structures like lists, trees and graphs, you should know that pointers are especially useful for implementing those. And sometimes you even have to use pointers, for example when working with files.
